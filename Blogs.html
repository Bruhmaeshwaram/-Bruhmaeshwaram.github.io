					Blog#1:Concentration
				</h1>
				<p>**Work Accomplished = Time Spent x Intensity**=(Time spent)x(Intensity of focus)<br>

					Distractions here, Distractions there, Distractions everywhere.<br>
					
					As we continue to live in a world where our attention is sought after by companies, It‚Äôs important to not fall back on our work and keep producing at our best possible level.<br>
					
					<i>*‚ÄúThe best students understood the role intensity plays in productivity and therefore went out of their way to maximize their concentration.‚Äù- Cal Newport in Deep work on what helps students achieve better.*</i>
					
					<br>Focusing on one task at a time and giving your best is the way to go if you wanna keep achieving as time passes.<br> As we log on to our devices every hour or so, scroll through a media site as we‚Äôre working or chatting to a friend while revising civics, We are clearly multi-tasking.<br> But the truth is we humans are horrible at multi-tasking and will end up not doing either task properly. Concentration plays a vital role in our life, regardless of if it‚Äôs studies or any personal goals.
					
					It‚Äôs always better to study or do your homework with a 100% concentration for an hour rather than doing it with a 50% concentration for 2 hours. This will help you maximize efficiency and understand what you‚Äôre actually doing rather than switching between two tasks and ending up getting nothing right. 
					
					<br>So the next time your studying, give all your concentration and once you‚Äôre done, enjoy your break, It‚Äôs that simple.
					
					<br>See you next week!</p>

					<h1>
						Blog#2:The Eudaimonia Machine
					</h1>
					<p> Before I start off, I would like to introduce two concepts because well If I do not, then you might not understand anything about today‚Äôs topic.
	
						<br>**Deep work**: *Professional activities performed in a state of distraction free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replace.*
						
						For Example- Something that you could relate to is doing hard math problems, or writing research papers, these tasks require to intensely concentrate and make you think to your maximum ability thereby producing work that is hard to replace and of value.
						
						<br>**Shallow work**: *Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.*
						
						For example- Replying to emails, Data entry, work that doesn‚Äôt produce any value and can be easily replicated by anyone.
						
						<br>So now, for today‚Äôs topic, the eudaimonia machine
						
						<br>The Greek Concept of ‚Äòeudaimonia‚Äô(a state where you are achieving your full human potential) inspires the Eudaimonia Machine. A space designed for the sole purpose of enabling the deepest possible deep work.
						
						<br>Since deep work requires intense concentration and a distraction free environment, this concept of a place where you can achieve the deepest possible deep work comes from a Chicago based architect, David Dewane.
						
						<br>It is a linear series of room or stages where one cannot reach the next level/room without going through the first.
						
						<br>First, **The gallery**
						
						<br>: This room would contain examples of deep work produced by the organization. It is meant to inspire employees and to create a culture of healthy stress and peer pressure.
						
						<br>Second, **The salon**: This room would contain access to high-quality coffee and perhaps a cafe. It would be furnished with couches and Wi-Fi. The salon is intended to create a mood somewhere between intense curiosity and argumentation. This is a place to debate, brood, and generally work through the ideas that will be developed deeper in the machine.
						
						<br>Third, **The library**: This room stores a permanent record of all work, as well as previous books and resources used by the organization. The room would contain copiers and scanners for gathering and collecting information needed for a project. The library should be considered the hard drive of the machine.
						
						<br>Fourth, **The office space**: The office space would contain a standard conference room and cubicles with desks. The office space is intended for low-intensity activity. This is the space designated to complete the less demanding efforts required for a project. An administrator with a desk in the office space could help occupants improve their work habits to optimize their efficiency.
						
						<br>Fifth, **The chamber**: The final room of the machine is a collection of deep work chambers. Each chamber is intended to be six by ten feet and protected by soundproof walls. The purpose of the deep work chamber is to allow for total focus and uninterrupted workflow.
						
						<br>(Source- Deep work by Cal Newport)
						
						<br>So, how it goes is that once you go through the first 4 stages which compromise mostly of shallow work efforts for your project, you go into the chambers for about 90 minutes and then a 90-minute break and repeat the process 2-3 times a day since performing deep work is mentally straining and challenging.
						
						<br>Now, why would we need something like this at all? Our offices have private cabins and privacy is always available. The truth is, that we as an economy are moving towards and starting a ubiquitous culture of connectivity. A place where your ‚Äòbusyness‚Äô online is seen as your contribution and that always being online during work is necessary for you to reach your potential. That, these tools such as slack and teams will help you work better and contribute more. Mindlessly surrounding yourself with distractions while trying to achieve your best potential. üòÇ
						
						<br>To escape this rather hostile culture that is being popularized in the workplace, this idea of a Eudaimonia machine seems like a ray of hope for when companies may realize that deep work would profit them! The segments clearly replicate the stages you need to go through to get into a state of deep work one by one to achieve the final state i.e., when you are distraction-free, concentrating and pushing yourself to your limit to produce work which is extremely valuable.
						
						<br>Even though it does not seem like we would get something like this in our workplace anytime in the future, the idea of a place where one can achieve their potential in a distraction-free environment and keep working to produce at their very best level is insane!

<h1>Blog#3:Exams</h1>
<p>As Exam season approaches for some of us, tensions and anxiety are on an ever high. It‚Äôs kind of important to understand that Exams are just a tool to help us gauge our understanding of a particular topic/subject. As Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet

	<br> <i>‚ÄòThere is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so.‚Äô</i>
	 
	
	<br>Exams are just a piece of paper we give meaning to. While a bad exam may not be the end of the road for you, You just have to work hard and we‚Äôll all have a good future and succeed.
	
	<br>So, here are some tips I think can be useful while preparing for an Exam:
	
	<br>We have to understand that the night before an exam is not really about revision but about setting yourself up for the big day. Some things to keep in mind are:-
	
	<br>- Sleep- Sleep is the time where memory is consolidated and new connections are made. Therefore, it‚Äôs kind of important that you get the optimal time of sleep not only to be refreshed but also for the memory to be consolidated. So sleep early and try not to cram up at nightüòÑ
	<br>- The night before an exam is no longer about understanding. You want to optimize time by using Active recall techniques like blurting( literally means to blurt out whatever you know and fixing the gaps in your knowledge) and flashcards. The best thing to do would be start applying the information you would have learnt, Start completing past paper questions or practice worksheets and basically tons of questions. Trying to create an exam like scenario beforehand makes exams feel less scary.
	<br>- For peace of mind, consider making yourself a last-minute cheat sheet with all the niggling point you want to go over in the final moments. The process of making it useful to pick out what you really don‚Äôt know and rereading it on the day gives you peace of mind.
	<br>- If you‚Äôre usually unprepared for an exam due to the stress and anxiety the night before, First, plan your wake-up alarm accordingly, and make a checklist for all the resources you might need for the exam. Make sure to pack your bag the night before and cross check a couple of times if you have everything you need.
	<br>- If you‚Äôre struggling to sleep, First, get off your phone or laptop and stop panicking in the group chat. Secondly, have a proper bedtime wind-down, take your mind off revision once you‚Äôre done and just do an exercise that would clear your head. Third, find a way to express how you‚Äôre feeling before since exam season is not a sprint but a(long and evil) marathon.
	<br>- An underused mindfulness technique is positive visualization. Based on a branch of human memory called Hebbian learning. The basic idea is that the more you think of something, the easier it is to think the same thing again. The reason this is so powerful is because it lets you break old ways of thinking about exams and take conscious control over your approach. It allows you to make your brain a friend, a trusty accomplice, rather than an enemy.
	
	<br>An example would be to Imagine yourself in the exam hall slowly going through the paper and looking and reading at each question with a deep feeling of: *I‚Äôve got this*
	
	<br>Imagine yourself finding a question that you don‚Äôt understand and instead of panicking calmly working through it using whatever knowledge you do have. Imagine yourself being logical, trusting that somewhere in your brain you have the jigsaw pieces to get somewhere on this question. It‚Äôs something new for me too so we might as well try itüòÄ.
	
	<br>All these tips and tricks are from a book I absolutely loved and would recommend:
	
	<br><b>‚Äú*The only Study Guide you‚Äôll ever need‚Äù by Jade Bowler. She also has a YouTube channel by the tag ‚ÄúUnjaded Jade‚Äù.*</b>
	
	<br>All the best for your exams!</p>

				<h1>Blog#4:Challenging Yourself</h1>
				We often tend to think that relaxation and enjoyment can come from just lying on the couch watching television or chatting to friends, but the truth is we humans love to be challenged. We love to be challenged and enjoy a certain activity when it pushes us beyond the level of our current ability. This is related to the concept of ‚Äòflow.‚Äô

				<i>Flow is a state of mind in which a person becomes fully immersed in an activity.</i> 
				
				
				<br>Positive psychologist¬†[Mih√°ly Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi](https://www.verywellmind.com/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi-biography-2795517)
				
				<br>Surely there must have been times when you would have felt completely immersed in an activity you were doing. It could be you were overlearning a concept you are interested in or an athletic activity that is beyond your usual abilities. All these activities result in such deep immersion that you are focused on the task at hand and nothing else. A state when you are enjoying the task and it is neither too hard nor too easy, that is it is challenging you to think or perform more than you ever have.
				
				<br>A recent example I would personally like to cite is when I participated in Bengaluru Midnight Marathon 2022 10K category. I had previously run a 5K when I was young but going into this race, I was not prepared. I had neither practiced running or stamina build-up, but I knew that running 10 Kilometres was quite possible and that it was going to be a mental battle not a physical one. I finished the race at 57 minutes on the clock and was satisfied with the fact that I was able to complete the race. Throughout the second round, every step was painful, my legs felt like they were dead, and my brain told me to stop and take a small walk, but I kept going. The whole time all I did was tell myself ‚ÄúOne more step. One more step‚Äù till the finish line. I never did realize that I took an hour because of the focus I had, time was irrelevant during the run. This is an example of flow since I was absorbed in a task I loved(running) and there was an internal motivation to achieve and finish the challenge without stopping. The task was attainable, but it was neither too easy nor too hard, this is the state of ‚Äòflow.‚Äô
				
				<br>Applying this concept to our lives, we must always try to go a step further, try to challenge ourselves in our areas of interest or for pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. Only when our brain is pushed to its limits, we feel satisfaction of completion and accomplishment.
				
				<br>Flow has a number of positive benefits and leads to better emotional regulation, higher intrinsic motivation, and greater creativity. It is a characteristic that you can utilize to do better. Hence, try to use this state of ‚Äòflow‚Äô in your life and see the benefits yourself!
				
				<br>Here‚Äôs a link if you want to know more about the state of ‚Äòflow‚Äô

							<h1>Blog#5:New Year New me?</h1>
<p><br>As 2022 comes to an end, It‚Äôs the time of the year to get make some resolutions for the coming year, right? I mean everyone does make a resolution but how many of us complete it?
	Studies suggest that only about 15% of the people stick to their goals and see some considerable changes in their lifestyle. But why is this? Why are we unable to go through and complete the very resolutions we make, the changes we want to see in our lives?
	There could be multiple reasons like your goal could be unrealistic or you do not know why you want to achieve your goal or even that you‚Äôre bored of the process. Procrastination is also a major factor; how can I forget that! But let's think on how we can turn this around and try to finish our resolution.
	For Instance, I set a goal of reading 15 books this year, any genre. Seems pretty possible right? Except, I don‚Äôt follow through with it. I might start off by finishing the first book in 2-3 weeks and feel good about myself but then not even start the second one. I‚Äôll blame lack of time, many commitments in school and what not!
	The problem here is that setting a goal is easy, but accomplishing it requires self-discipline. Here‚Äôs a famous quote from James Clear In Atomic Habits about this very problem.
	
	<br><i>‚ÄúYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
		<br>Your goal is your desired outcome. Your system is the collection of daily habits that will get you there.
		<br>This year, spend less time focusing on outcomes and more time focusing on the habits that precede the results.‚Äù</i>
	
	
	<br>Rather than setting a goal, and just winging it, Create a system. A system that keeps you accountable, that tracks your progress, that makes smaller goals and allows you to reach your destination slowly but steadily. It is the journey that matters, not the destination. Slowly work your way towards the goal, Yes, it will take time and it requires patience. You might not feel the effects of your efforts each day but as you keep completing your mini goals, they‚Äôll soon translate into your final one.
	<br>Using the example I used earlier, Now that I know I want to read 15 books this year. I‚Äôll first start off by making of a list of books that I would like to read. Then an estimated period for each book and try to balance it out with the time I have. Accordingly, if I want to make a smaller goal for each day so that I can follow through with it, I can add a minimum number of pages per day. Hence by breaking down my large goal into smaller goals and creating a system to keep myself accountable, I can hopefully go on and achieve the goal! Thus, this time if you want to set a resolution, try, and create a system to help yourself achieve it! All the best and See you next yearüòÅ.</p>
